<!--l. 888--><p class="noindent" >From using other schedulers you may be accustomed to the idea that a forecasting suite has a &#8220;current cycle time&#8221;,
which is typically the analysis time or nominal start time of the main forecast model(s) in the suite, and that the
whole suite advances to the next forecast cycle when all tasks in the current cycle have finished (or even when a
particular wall clock time is reached, in real time operation). As is explained in the Introduction, this is not how
cylc works.
</p><!--l. 896--><p class="indent" >   Cylc suites advance by means of individual tasks with private cycle times independently spawning successors at
the next valid cycle time for the task, not by incrementing a suite-wide forecast cycle. Each task will be submitted
when its own prerequisites are satisfied, regardless of other tasks with other cycle times running, or
not, at the time. It may still be convenient at times, however, to refer to the &#8220;current cycle&#8221;, the
&#8220;previous cycle&#8221;, or the &#8220;next cycle&#8221; and so forth, with reference to a particular task, or in the sense of
all tasks that &#8220;belong to&#8221; a particular forecast cycle. But keep in mind that the members of these
groups may not be present simultaneously in the running suite - i.e.&#x00A0;different tasks may pass through
the &#8220;current cycle&#8221; (etc.) at different times as the suite evolves, particularly in delayed (catch up)
operation.
