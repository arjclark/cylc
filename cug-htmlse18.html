<!--l. 5126--><p class="noindent" >The graph view in the gcontrol GUI has the advantage that it shows the structure of a suite very clearly as it
evolves. It works remarkably well even for very large suites (up to several hundred tasks or more) <span 
class="cmti-10">but </span>because the
graphviz engine does a new global layout every time the graph changes the layout is often not very stable. This
may not be a solvable problem even in principle as it seems likely that making continual incremental
changes to an existing graph without redoing the global layout would inevitably result in a horrible
mess.
</p><!--l. 5135--><p class="indent" >   The following features of the graph view, however, help mitigate the the jumping layout problem:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The disconnect button can be used to temporarily prevent the graph from changing as the content of
     the suite changes (and in real time operation suites evolve quite slowly anyway)
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">In most suites, toggling the off-white &#8220;base graph&#8221; nodes (which do not represent current live task
     proxies and are just present to fill out the graph structure) will dramatically reduce the size of the
     graph (but it will split into several disconnected sub-trees).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Right-click on a task and choose the &#8220;Focus&#8221; option to restrict the graph display to that task&#8217;s cycle
     time. Anything interesting happening in other cycles will show up as disconnected rectangular nodes
     to the right of the graph (and you can click on those to intantly refocus to their cycles).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Task filtering is the ultimate quick route to temporarily focusing on just the tasks you&#8217;re interested in
     (but this will destroy the graph structure, to state the obvious).</li></ul>
