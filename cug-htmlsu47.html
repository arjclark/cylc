<!--l. 4404--><p class="noindent" >As a suite runs its tasks (or rather the task proxies that represent the real tasks) move through a series of defined
states:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">waiting </span>- prerequisites have not yet been satisfied (clock-triggered tasks also wait on their trigger
     time).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">queued </span>- ready to be submitted (i.e.&#x00A0;prerequisites satisfied) but temporarily held back by an internal
     cylc queue (see Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="cug-htmlsu49.html#x74-14700011.3.2">11.3.2<!--tex4ht:ref: InternalQueues --></a>).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">submitted </span>- submitted to be executed by the specified job submission method, but not yet running
     (it may be waiting in an external batch scheduler queue, for example).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">running </span>- the task &#8220;started&#8221; message received (sent when a task starts executing) but not yet finished.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">retry delayed </span>- if a task configures the &#8220;retry delays&#8221; item (a list of delay intervals in minutes), then
     if it fails it will be put in this state for the specified interval and then resubmitted after incrementing
     the task try number. A task only enters the final &#8220;failed&#8221; if the last retry fails.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">two finished states:
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">succeeded </span>- a <span 
class="cmti-10">succeeded  </span>task has finished successfully. It will remain in the suite so long as its
         outputs could be needed to satisfy the prerequisites of waiting tasks, and then it will be removed
         from the suite.
         </li>
         <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">failed </span>- a <span 
class="cmti-10">failed </span>task has aborted after reporting failure. Failed tasks are not automatically removed
         from the suite, they must be handled by the suite operator (e.g.&#x00A0;by retriggering after fixing the
         problem).</li></ul>
     </li></ul>
<!--l. 4443--><p class="indent" >   In addition, there are two held (paused) task states:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">held </span>- a <span 
class="cmti-10">held </span>task will not be submitted, even if it is ready to run, until it is released. Tasks that are
     already running cannot be held. The suite operator can deliberately hold tasks, and cylc itself puts
     tasks on hold under certain circumstances. For example, if the suite has been told to &#8220;shut down after
     currently running tasks have finished&#8221; waiting tasks will be put on hold while currently running tasks
     are finishing.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">runahead </span>- a task in the <span 
class="cmti-10">runahead </span>state has exceeded the suite runahead limit, i.e.&#x00A0;it has got &#8220;too
     far ahead&#8221; of the slowest tasks and will be held back until they have caught up sufficiently. This state
     is automatically managed by cylc. See <span 
class="cmti-10">The Suite Runahead Limit</span>, Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="cug-htmlsu49.html#x74-14600011.3.1">11.3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: RunaheadLimit --></a>.
     </li></ul>
<!--l. 4464--><p class="indent" >   Finally, you may see references to the following pseudo states:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">ready </span>- to set a task to <span 
class="cmti-10">ready </span>means to set all of its prerequisites satisfied - i.e.&#x00A0;ready to run (except
     clock-triggered tasks, which also wait on a trigger time).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">base </span>(Graph Control GUI only) - off-white base graph nodes do not represent current live task proxies
     in the suite, they just connect the current live nodes according to the full suite graph.</li></ul>
