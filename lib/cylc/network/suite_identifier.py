# A minimal Pyro-connected object to allow client programs to identify
# what suite is running at a given cylc port - by suite name and owner.

# All *other* suite objects should be connected to Pyro via qualified
# names: owner.suite.object, to prevent accidental access to the wrong
# suite. This object, however, should be connected unqualified so that
# that same ID method can be called on any active cylc port.
