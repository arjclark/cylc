The SVG diagrams were created in Inkscape. 

The eps files are derived from the SVG files, but by manual "Save As" in
Inkscape on each SVG diagram, which is a pain in the ass. So in lieu of 
automatic generation from the SVG originals I'm adding both SVG and eps
to the repository.  

The PDF files, however, are created on-the-fly during document
processing, from the eps files.
