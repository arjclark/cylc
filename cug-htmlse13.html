<!--l. 4810--><p class="noindent" >Until release 4.2.2 cylc had a &#8220;central suite database&#8221; that users could export to and import from, for sharing suites.
It was essentially just a special instance of a user suite database, held under the cylc admin account and with
associated export and import commands to copy suite definition directories to and from a central store, with the
suite owner&#8217;s username as the first hierarchical name component. However, it was not on the network, and the suite
store had to be writeable by all users and hence very insecure. Rather than develop a network server for better
security and wider access, as was the original intention, it was decided to remove this functionality entirely for the
following reasons:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Large sites are likely to have suite meta-data and revision control requirements and preferences beyond
     what can be provided by a light-weight native cylc database.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Small groups of light cylc users, on the other hand, can easily share suites by means of manually
     copying suite definitions, or with the <span class="lstinline"><span 
class="pcrr7t-">cylc</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">&#x00A0;</span><span 
class="pcrr7t-">copy</span></span> command which now supports copying registered
     suites between databases; they are then free to use preferred revision control tools and so on as they
     see fit.</li></ul>
<!--l. 4834--><p class="indent" >   We may in the future recommend particular tools that can be used for suite discovery, revision control, and so
on, with cylc suites.
